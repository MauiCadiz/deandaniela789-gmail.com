It is practically impossible to complete a task without utilizing technology of some kind. Similar, it is neither practicable nor feasible to completely stop using technology. It has both favorable and unfavorable effects. It's no secret that technology has aided us in unfathomable ways and is continuing to do so with constant advancements for the betterment of humanity. Some of the positives include adding satisfaction, improving communication channels, erasing geographical boundaries, and some negatives include rotundity, health issues, sleep problems, etc. The phrase mortal body is formed of cells, which progress with the progress around them, but over-progression of cells leads to cancer is used to describe how cells in the body age. Humanity is preoccupied with development because it is good. However, it has a variety of external and internal difficulties. The fact that the entire generation is on high alert and exhibiting increased rates of sadness, less physical activity, and decreased capacity to concentrate are clear indicators of these issues. Technology is also dangerous when it becomes redundant, so take a break now and then from all the barriers surrounding you and unwind.
